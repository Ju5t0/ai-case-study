## Overview and Origin (Apple Siri)
The name of this company is Apple inc. 
It was officialy incorporated in April 1st 1976.
The founders of this company are Steve Jobs, Ronald Wayne, and Steve Wozinak.
The idea for Siri originated from a project at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the late 2000s. The team developed a type of voice recognition technology that could understand natural language and provide context-aware responses. In the 2007, SRI spun off a company called Siri, Inc., which was then acquired by Apple in 2010. Apple integrated this new technology into iOS, launching Siri as a feature in the iPhone 4S in October 2011.
Apple is funded through its revenue from sales of hardware (things like iPhones, iPads, Macs), software, services, and subscriptions. As a publicly traded company, it has also raised funds through the issuance of some bonds and stocks.
## Business Activities
Siri aims to solve the problem of making technology more accessible and intuitive through voice interaction. It enables users to interact with their devices simplifying tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, and getting information. The goal here is for the AI to enhance user experience by providing a natural way to communicate with technology.
Siri's intended customers are primarily just Apple device users that use things like iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch. The market size is unbelivably large , given Appleâ€™s large user base; as of 2023, there are well over 1 billion active Apple devices worldwide.
